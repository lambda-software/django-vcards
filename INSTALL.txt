Thanks for downloading django-vcards.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included "vcards"
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path.

This application has been develop using Python 2.7 and Django 1.4,
maybe can run in older version but is not tested. 
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
